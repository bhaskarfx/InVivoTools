/* GetSetPixXor.cModifications:  2004-01-13 Steve Van Hooser, Brandeis University  Fixed a bug that only permitted dot size 3; made theCurrentValue and theNewValue  arbitrary length; they are allocated outside this file for speed.COPYRIGHT:  Copyright Michael Shadlen and the University of Washington, 1995.  This file may be distributed freely as long as this notice accompanies  it and any changes are noted in the source.

The function	reads the current bitmap in an m by m location, does and xor operation	with the value you send (arg3) and puts the result of the xor in the 	m by m square whose upper corner x,y is arg1, arg2.HISTORY:	3/27/96		mns	& jnk wrote it	11/12/97 	jig cleaned & optimized*/// includes#include "GetSetPixXor.h"/*ROUTINE: GetSetPixXor.c					writes a single pixel as bmval xor current value at that locationARGS:		x0,y0 	pos of upper left corner of the dot		bmval		the bitmap value of a dot written on a 0 background		sz			size of the dot: sz by sz pixels*/void GetSetPixXor(int x0, int y0, unsigned char bmval, short sz,		unsigned long theCurrentValue[],unsigned long theNewValue[]){	register int  row, j;	// Do it row-by-row	for (row=sz; row>0; row--, y0++) {				// get the values		GetPixelsQuickly(x0, y0, theCurrentValue, sz);				// set one row of sz dots to DOTVAL		for (j=0; j<sz; j++)			theNewValue[j] = (unsigned long)(bmval ^ (unsigned char)theCurrentValue[j]);		// set the new values		SetPixelsQuickly(x0, y0, theNewValue, sz);	}}
