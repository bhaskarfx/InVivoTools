The function	reads the current bitmap in an m by m location, does and xor operation	with the value you send (arg3) and puts the result of the xor in the 	m by m square whose upper corner x,y is arg1, arg2.HISTORY:	3/27/96		mns	& jnk wrote it	11/12/97 	jig cleaned & optimized*/// includes#include "SetPixCopy.h"/*ROUTINE: SetPixCopy.c					writes a single pixel as bmval at that locationARGS:		x0,y0 	pos of upper left corner of the dot		bmval		the bitmap value of a dot written on a 0 background		sz			size of the dot: sz by sz pixels*/void SetPixCopy(int x0, int y0, unsigned char bmval, short sz,		unsigned long theNewValue[]){	register int  row;	// Do it row-by-row	for (row=sz; row>0; row--, y0++) {			// set the new values		SetPixelsQuickly(x0, y0, theNewValue, sz);	}}
