move ReceptiveFieldmapper out of NewStim
move SaveScripts somewhere else (LeveltLabTools?)
save @borderscript, @hupescript, @lammemotionscript, @lammetexturescript
save @borderstim, @lammestim, @hupestim
save adjust_duration.m, checkscript.m  (back to NelsonLabTools?)
save NewStimList, NewStimScriptList
save StimEndSound, StimErrorSound



Questions for Steve:
- is 'adjust_duration.m' still part of the code?
- is 'checkscript.m'  still part of the code?

- I have implemented NewStimList and NewStimScriptList as by getting all class files from the Stimuli and Script directories. Isn't that nicer?

- Should ReceptiveFieldMapper not go into NewStim?

- Should RFmap.m be in NewStimServices?

- why all the evals in NewStimInit instead of direct function calls?
